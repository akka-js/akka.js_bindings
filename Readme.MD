# Akka.Js Bindings

*this project is EXPERIMENTAL*

Feedbacks are highly appreciated!

Right now this project is a playground to experiment how Akka.Js can expose a useful API to JavaScript developers.

To run the pingpong example simply clone this project and:
```bash
cd pingpong
node
> require("./pingpong")
```

If you wanna contribute but have trouble in building, please join Akka.js gitter channel.
